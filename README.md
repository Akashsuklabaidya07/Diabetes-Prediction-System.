# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on several health indicators. The prediction model is built using Logistic Regression and Flask is used to deploy the model. 

Users can input details like pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age, and the application will predict the likelihood of diabetes.
