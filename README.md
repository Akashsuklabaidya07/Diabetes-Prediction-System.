Diabetes Prediction System
Overview
The Diabetes Prediction System is a web application that uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is diabetic based on various health parameters. The system leverages a machine learning model trained on a dataset and allows users to input their health data to receive predictions. The predictions and user data are stored in a MongoDB database.
